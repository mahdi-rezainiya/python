#variable: a item refrence to a part of hard
#value: we put it in variable
x = 10
type(x) = integer
y = 10.2
type(y) = float
z1 = "mahdi"
type(z1) = string
z2 = "mahdi@14"
type(z2) = string
z3 = "18"
type(z3) = string
you type z3 then ctrl + enter = "18"
you can do: print()+ input:name of variable
name = 'ali''s laptop'
name1 ="ali's laptop"
print(name) = alis laptop
print(name1) = ali's laptop
text = "hello, this is just a test"
print(text) = hello, this is just a test
just print text then ctrl+enter = hello, this is just a test
2p = 18 = syntax error because variable we can't add number before name
p 2 = 18 = syntax error because variable name can't have space
_p =18 : not error it is ok , we can add before or between variable _ 
students_class_python = 18
_ = 18 : we can add just _ for variable name
name = "    hello, My name is mahdi    "
name.title() =     Hello, My Name Is Mahdi    this method can change first letter of words to capital letter 
name.upper() =     HELLO, MY NAME IS MAHDI    this method can change all of the letters to capital letter
name.lower() =     hello, my name is mahdi    this method can change all of the letters to low letters, this method is important in programming
age = 15
age.upper() = AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'upper' because int or float is not available in this item so lower and title do not work in int or float
fname = "mahdi"
lname = "rezainiya"
fname+lname = mahdirezainiya    this method is concatination (can merge something together)
age = 18
age+fname = TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str' because we can not concate other type with together
30+10 = 40 can plus to numbers
age1 = 30
age2 = 32
